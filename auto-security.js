                AUTOMATING SECURITY WITH GITHUB ACTIONS

### **Automating Security with GitHub Actions**
**GitHub Actions Workflow** for automated security checks and deployments.

1. **Create a `security.yml` Workflow**:
   ```yaml
   name: Security Checks

   on: push

   jobs:
     security-audit:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout Code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3

       - name: Run ESLint
         run: npm run lint

       - name: OWASP ZAP Scan
         uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v1
         with:
           target: "https://your-api-url.com"

       - name: Dependency Audit
         run: npm audit
   ```

2. **Benefits**:
   - Automatically checks for vulnerabilities on every push.
   - Integrates with deployment pipelines to ensure secure releases.

## **Final Workflow Integration**
Integrating all components:
1. **Frontend**:
   - Use **Helmet.js** for secure headers.
   - Validate user inputs in the form using libraries like **Formik** or **Yup**.
2. **Backend**:
   - Secure APIs with **Passport.js** and **JWT**.
   - Implement **RBAC** and sanitize inputs.
3. **API Gateway**:
   - Use tools like **AWS API Gateway** to manage traffic and enforce security policies.
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automate security checks, testing, and deployments using **GitHub Actions**.
