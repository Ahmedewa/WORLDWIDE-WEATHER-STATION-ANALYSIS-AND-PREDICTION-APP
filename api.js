     RESTful API LIMITS
### ðŸš¦ API Rate Limits
**Challenges**: Limited requests per minute disrupt real-time updates  
**Solutions**:
- Introduce **caching mechanisms** (e.g., Redis) to reduce redundant API calls.
- Schedule **batch processing** for non-critical data.
- Use **API gateways** with throttling and retry logic (e.g., AWS API Gateway).

### ðŸ“Š Scalability
**Challenges**: Handling large historical datasets and peak loads  
**Solutions**:
- Use **cloud-native databases** like BigQuery or Snowflake for scalable storage.
- Implement **horizontal scaling** with container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
- Apply **data partitioning and indexing** for faster queries.

### ðŸŽ¯ Prediction Accuracy
**Challenges**: Limited data for rare events, model complexity  
**Solutions**:
- Use **transfer learning** and **synthetic data generation** to augment training sets.
- Collaborate with global agencies (e.g., USGS, JMA) for enriched datasets.
- Continuously **validate and retrain models** with new data to improve accuracy.
